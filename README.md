# Samples.SOLID

The renowned computer scientist Robert J. Martin, also known as Uncle Bob, initially presented the SOLID principles in his 2000 paper. However, it was Michael Feathers who later introduced the SOLID acronym.

Purpose: "To create understandable, readable, and testable code that many developers can collaboratively work on."

## SRP
- Single Responsability Principle
There should never be more than one reason for a class to change

## OCP
- Open Close Principle
Software entities ... should be open for extension, but closed for modification

## LSP
- Liskov Substitution Principle
Functions that use pointers or references to base classes must be able to use objects of derived classes without knowing it.

"If it looks like a duck, quacks like a duck, but needs batteries â€“ you probably have the wrong abstraction"


## ISP
- Interface Segregation Principle
Clients should not be forced to depend upon interfaces that they do not use.

## DIP
- Dependency Inversion Principle
Depend upon abstractions, [not] concretions.
